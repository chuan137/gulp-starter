# gulp starter

My boilerplate for starting a front-end project with gulp as the build tool.

### Features
* project 1: Ractive
  * use *bower* to manage front-end packages
  * use *browserify* with *debowerify*, packages installed from bower are avalaible to javascript scripts
  * use *gulp* to build and watch

* project 2: React
  * pack jquery, backbone and underscore in global.js
  * watch changes and build
